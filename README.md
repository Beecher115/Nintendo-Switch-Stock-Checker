# Nintendo-Switch-Stock-Checker
Python web parser that will check Smyths and GameStop websites for Nintendo Switch stock and check Littlewoods website to see if Nintendo Switch is listed.

Littlewoods robots.txt allows web crawlers but must have a User Agent.
Harvey Normans robots.txt does not allow web crawlers.

Argos and Currys also list Nintendo Switch stock but have an "Email when back in stock" feature so I didn't feel the need to parse their websites.
